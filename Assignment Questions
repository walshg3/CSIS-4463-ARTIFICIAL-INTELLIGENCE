6) Answer the following questions:

6A) Describe in words the relative pattern of number of expanded states for UCS and A* 
    with the two different heuristics.

6B)	Why do we find that pattern?

6C) Describe in words the relative pattern of number of expanded states for Iterative Deepening 
    and IDA* with the two different heuristics.
	
6D) Why do we find that pattern? And how does that pattern compare to what you saw in 6A and 6B?  

6E) Describe the memory usage (max states in memory) that you observed for UCS, and the
    two variations of A*.
	
6F) Describe the relative memory usage (max states in memory) that you observed for Iterative Deepening 
    and IDA* with the two different heuristics.
	
6G) Explain the memory usage that you observed for the three iterative deepening algorithms (IDA* and ID) 
    versus the others (UCS and A*).
